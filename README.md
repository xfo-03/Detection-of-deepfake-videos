# A Deep-learning approach using Frame-level analysis for the detection of deepfake videos
Final year thesis/project,
Feb-May,2023.
We developed a deep learning (DL) architecture for the detection of deepfake
videos using frame level analysis.
The approach involves feature extraction from histogram analysis, edge detection
and texture analysis of frames. The DL architecture leverages the power of a
Multi-Layer Perceptron Architecture to identify patterns and features that
distinguish deepfake videos from authentic ones from the FaceForensics++
dataset.
